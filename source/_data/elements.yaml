  description: "Particularly in developing economies, where resources to put toward data release or data use can be in short supply, a clear, detailed understanding of the problem to be addressed by open data can help to ensure that efforts are targeted and optimized. Some of the most effective open data projects examined here are laser-focused on a specific user group (e.g., smallholder farmers in Colombia or Ghana), or identified gap (e.g., the lack of power quality in the Indian energy sector). Clearly defining the problem can also aid in the development of metrics of success and a strategy for monitoring progress against a well-defined baseline. Many of the initiatives studied as part of this project lacked such a monitoring strategy, making assessments of impact, evidence-driven iteration, and the demonstration of return on investment more challenging."

  description: The release and use of open data in developing economies are not without risks. An upfront mapping and consideration of risks associated with intended uses of open data can allow practitioners to design programs from the outset in a way that is well-positioned to overcome or mitigate those risks. The risks listed here, however, should not be considered arguments against using open data in development. Rather, they are reasons for taking a more fine-grained approach that pays close attention to the empirical evidence, sifting out what works and what does not, and identifying conditions for scaling and replication.
